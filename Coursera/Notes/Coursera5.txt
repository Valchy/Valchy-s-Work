OAuth - An open standart that allows users to grant third-party websites and applications to access their information without sharing account credentials
Access Control List (ACL) - A way of defining permissions or authorizations for objects
Accounting - Keeping records of what resources and services your users accessed or what they did when they were using your systems
Network Hardening - The process of securing a network by reducing its potential vulnerabilities through configuration changes and taking specific steps
Implicit Deny - A network security concept where anything not explicitly permitted or allowed should be denied

Types of Malicious Software:
Malware - A type of malicious software that can be used to obtain your sensitive information or delete / modify files
Adware - Software that displays advertisements and collects data
Virus - attaches itself to some sort of executable code like a program. When the program is running, it touches many files,
each of which is now susceptible to being infected with the virus. So, the virus replicates itself on these files, does the malicious work it's intended to do,
and repeats this over and over until it spreads as far as it can.
Worm - Worms are similar to viruses except that instead of having to attach themselves onto something to spread,
worms can live on their own and spread through channels like the network.
Trojan - Malware that disguises itself as one thing but does something else
Spyware - Type of malware that's meant to spy on you
Keylogger - A common type of spyware that's used to record every keystroke you make
Ransomeware - A type of attack that hold your data or system hostage until you pay some sort of ransom

What does TLS grants us:
1) A secure communication line which means data beign transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers
2) The ability to authenticate both parties communicating, thorugh typically only the server is authenticated by the client
3) The integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren't lost or altered in transit

Three A's of Security:
1. Authentication
2. Autherization
3. Accounting
