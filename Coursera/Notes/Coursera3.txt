Course 3 - Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User

Paths: in windows its with a '\' and in Linux its with a '/'
bin dir in Linux is like Program Files in windows
~ or Tilde references our home directory (~/Desktop works :D)
in Bash the escape character is \ while in windows cli its ` (eg. My` Cool` Folder or My\ Cool\ Folder)
Wildcrd - A character that's used to help select files based on certain pattern (eg * (all) cp *.jpg ~/Desktop)
nano + text file is a text editor for the bash
echo - is a I/O stream, logs what was written
Input/output streams (I/O streams) 1. stdout 2. stdin 3. stderr
Windows domain - A network of computers, users, files, etc that are added to a central database
User Access Control (UAC) - A feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to a system
windows + R then type netplwiz to view users and groups on windows home
In windows, files and directory permissions are assigned using Access Control Lists or ACLs.
Two types of SSH keys: public (lock something which then can only be opened by the private keys) or private (hidden key with which you can open the lock)
VirtualBox (program) allows you to create your own VMs
SSH - Secure Shell, A protocol implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another
VPN - Virtual Private Network, allows you to connect to a private network, live your work network over the internet
Remote Connection - Allows us to manage multiple machines from anywhere in the work without being physically there
PuTTY - a free, open source softwear that you can use to make remote connections through several netowrk protocols, including SSH (default port SSH uses is 22), (it also supports the SCP protocol)
SCP - Secure Copy, is a command you can use in Linux to copy files between computers on a network
Virtual Instance - a single virtual machine (VM)

Commands:
(for AWS) - sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop || status || start || restart apache || restart (stop apache stuff, after .sh it can be either)
(VM timer run command) - crontab -e <command>
- touch - creates a file
- ls (list) params: the directory -Force = shows hidden files, -l = gives additional information, -a shows hidden files
- pwd (tells us in what directory we are in)
- cd (change directory) - changes dir you are in
- mkdir (make directory) - creates a folder
- rmdir (removes a directory) - removes a folder
- history (shows history commands) ctrl+r
- cp (copy its like ctrl+c) -Recurse = copies sub files and dirs if there are, -verbose = prints new line for every copy
- mv (move or rename) eg mv filenamedir newName or mv filenamedir newfilenamedir
- rm (remove) deletes files (doesnt go to bin) -Force removes it even if you dont have some permissions
- cat (view content) use instead of cat head or tail to see only beginning or end of file
- less (more interractive way to read a file) q = quits, move with up, down arrow key, g = go beginning, G = go end of file / = word_search
- /? to get info on command or --help
- net (like password change, on next log on password change etc, remove / add user)
- passwd + name of user (for Linux password change)
- Get-LocalUser and Get-LocalGroupMember + name of group (this is for windows shell)
- sudo cat /etc/passwd and sudo cat /etc/group

Selectors:
- * (all)
- $null (nothing) or /dev/null
