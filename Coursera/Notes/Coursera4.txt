IT Infrastructure - encompasses the softwear, hardwear, network, an services required for an organisation to operate in an enterprise IT environment.
Server - Softwear or a machine that provides services to other softwear or machines
Data Center - afacility that stores hundrets if not thousands of servers
FTP (File Transport Protocol) - has no encryption but has authnetication for sending. Protocol for sending data
SFTP (Secure File Transport Protocol) - unlike FTP SFTP encrypts the data and is like SSH. Protocol for sending data
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) - like FTP but also has no authentication
NTP (Network Time Protocol) - keeps clocks on machines syncronised (so the time everywhere is the same xd)
Intranet - An internal network inside a company; accessible if you are on a company's network
Proxy Server - Acts as a bridge between a company's network and the internet
NFS (Network File System) - a protocol that enables files to be shared over a network
Load Balancer - Ensures that each VM recieves a balanced number of queries
Autoscalinig - It allows the service to increase or reduce capacity as needed while the server owner only pays for the cast of the machines that are in use at any given time
Directory Server - Contains a lookup service that provides mapping between network resources and their network addresses
Replication - the stored directory data can be copied and distributed across a number of physically distributed servers but still appear as one unified datastore for querying and administrating
Directory Services - Useful for organising data and making it searchable for an organisation
Centralised Management - A central service that provides instructions to all of the different parts of my IT infrastructure
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Acess Protocol [Newer version of DAP pretty much] - Used to access information in directory services like over a network
Kerberos - a network authentication protocol thats used to authenticate user identity secure the transfer of user credentials and more
Active Directory (AD) - The native directory service for microsoft windows
Post-mortem - a way for you to document any problems you discovered along the way and most importantly the ways you fixed them so you make sure they dont happen again
Rsync - a file transfer utility that's designed to efficently transfer and synchronise files between locations or computers
Compessing the data to eb backed up is good in a way that now it requires less space but at the same time the down side is that it takes more time to get decompressed afterwords
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - a method of taking multiple physical disks and combining them into one large virtual disk
GPO (Group Policy Object) - A set of policies and preferences that can be applied to a group of objects in the directory
Windows Registry - A hierarchical database of settings that Windows and many Windows applicaations use for storing configuration data

File Transfer Protocols:

| Name | Encryption | Authentication |
| FTP  |      ✘		|       ✔  	 |
| SFTP |     ✔ 	|  	    ✔ 		 |
| TFTP |      ✘ 	|        ✘   	 |

Computer Life Cycle:
1. Procurement
2. Deployment
3. Maintenance
4. Retirement

Types of Backups:
* Defferential Backup - Back ups only files and data that has changed since the last backup. Advantage is there isn't duplicated data being backed up
* Full Backup - Back ups everything (safest but also most space consuming option)
* Incremental Backup - only the data that's changed in files since the last incremental backup is backed up
* Partial Backups - Back ups specfic parts and so eliminates of backing up all the unneccessary pictures of cats lets say
